## Introduction

This repository collects code examples, explanations, and practice problems on various data structures and algorithms using C++. It aims to help learners understand the fundamental concepts of DSA and implement them efficiently.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
   cd data-structures-and-algorithms
   ```
2. **Compile and Run:** Use a C++ compiler to compile and run the examples. For example:
   ```bash
    g++ arrays/array_example.cpp -o array_example
    ./array_example
    ```
3. **Explore the Code:** Navigate through the folders to explore different data structures and algorithms.
